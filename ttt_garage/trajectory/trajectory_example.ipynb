    "# Trajectory optimization of a commercial airliner\n",
    "\n",
    "Trajectory optimization is a critical task for maximizing the performance of aircraft, spacecraft, and other vehicles. By determining the optimal trajectory, engineers can improve fuel efficiency, reduce emissions, and increase range, among other benefits. In this example, we focus on the optimization of a commercial airliner's trajectory to maximize its range while flying at a constant Mach number with a fixed initial fuel load.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ability to optimize a commercial airliner's trajectory is of great importance for the aviation industry. Airlines are constantly looking for ways to reduce fuel consumption, which is a significant portion of their operating costs. By optimizing the aircraft's trajectory, airlines can reduce fuel consumption and increase the aircraft's range, allowing them to serve longer routes or carry more passengers and cargo. Additionally, trajectory optimization can help reduce emissions, which is becoming increasingly important as the aviation industry works to address climate change.\n",
    "\n",
    "The techniques used in this example are applicable to a wide range of vehicles, including spacecraft and military aircraft. In spaceflight, trajectory optimization is crucial for missions such as interplanetary travel or satellite deployment. For military aircraft, trajectory optimization can improve mission effectiveness by maximizing range, minimizing time to target, or reducing exposure to threats.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, trajectory optimization is a crucial task for improving the performance of aircraft, spacecraft, and other vehicles. By using advanced techniques such as differential inclusion and collocation/psuedospectral methods, engineers can optimize trajectories to achieve a wide range of performance benefits.\n",
