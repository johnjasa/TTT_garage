# Welcome to the TTT Garage!

NASA's Transformational Tools and Technologies (TTT) project develops cutting-edge computational and experimental tools and technologies that enable the prediction of future aircraft performance in flight. This project creates computer-based tools, models, and scientific knowledge that can be applied to the entire Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) portfolio.

As part of the TTT project, we are pleased to present a collection of open-source engineering models. These models, created using industry-standard tools like OpenMDAO and OpenVSP, are designed to showcase real-world engineering problems and demonstrate how they can be solved using computational tools.

Our collection of models covers a wide range of engineering disciplines, including aerodynamics, structures, controls, and propulsion. Each model is accompanied by detailed explanations, including code examples, that show how they work and how they can be modified to solve similar problems.

At NASA, we believe in the importance of promoting open-source technologies. By sharing our models and encouraging others to do the same, we can accelerate innovation and drive progress in the aerospace industry. We hope that you find our collection of models useful and that they inspire you to explore the possibilities of open-source engineering.
